# GraphQL Learning

`GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs that allows a client to specify what data it needs. A GraphQL server can fetch data from separate sources for a single client query and present the results in a unified graph. It is not tied to any specific database or storage engine.`


### In this Project - I used dummy external APIs 
Some times External Dummy APIs won't return Accurate data - So it will throw error. After refreshing the page many times when it gets data it will show table with that data.
